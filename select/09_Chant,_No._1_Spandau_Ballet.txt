I checked the time, it was almost time
A kind of curious smell, an intangible crime
Well I'm washing my clothes, but the stain still grows
Cover your eyes, the stain still shows

I feel the gaze against my skin
I feel the grease against my skin
I know this feeling is a lie

There is a guilt within my mind
There s a guilt within my mind
I know this feeling is a lie
I know this feeling is a lie

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on

Oh I should question not ignore
I should question not ignore
Songs are always buried deep

There's a lion in my arms
There is a motion in my arm
Oh I should question not ignore
I should believe and not ignore no

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
No no nooo
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on

You go down, down, pass the off of the town
You go down greek street then it's underground
Soho life for this mobile knife
It's the place to shoot friday night beat route

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on, no no no no noooo
(I don't need this pressure on)
(I don't need this pressure on)
(I don't need this pressure on)
(I don't need this pressure on)
(I don't need this pressure on)
(I don't need this pressure on)
