Yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah, oh.
My butterflies won't go away.
When they call your name I go insane.
I feel love inside my jeans.
I'd take a car, a boat, a train, a plane,
Kill anyone that got in my way.
The kind of love that never strays.
Well I'm your number one fan, your number one fan, yeah, oh.
I sent you a letter a day,
I found out the places you were staying.
Fake names never got in my way.
I'd take a car, a boat, a train, a plane,
Kill anyone that got in my way.
The kind of love thar never strays.
Well I'm your number one fan, your number one fan, yeah, oh.
I'd kill the president, Kill the president, kill the president.
I've read everything that you wrote.
I'm saying everything that you've said.
I've watched every screen that you've played on.
I'd take a car, a boat, a train, a plane,
Kill anyone that got in my way.
The kind of love that never strays.
Cause I'm your number one fan. Your number one fan, yeah.
I'd kill the president
I'd kill the president.
I'd kill the president (For your love)
